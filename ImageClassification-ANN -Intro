This workshop is for PhD students of the School of Collective Intelligence.
In this workshop we will learn how to set up python environment for machine learning using ANACONDA and build an artificial neural 
network model for handwritten digits classification.

1.	Setup Your Python Environment for machine learning
a.	Install Anaconda 
# Anaconda is a collection of scientific Python packages, tools, resources, and IDEs.
b.	Check python and anaconda info
c.	Lunch jupyter 
d.	Install packages
2. Build your ANN model for handwritten digits classification
